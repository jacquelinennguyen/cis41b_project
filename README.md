Final Project for Nguyen CIS41B Winter 2021. 

Authors: [Fawaz Al-Harbi](https://github.com/monsieurCat), [Kaede Hamada](https://github.com/KaeMaple9), and [Jacqueline Nguyen](https://github.com/jacquelinennguyen).

## ðŸŽ¶ Overview
>***UPDATE 3/23/2021***
> Upon first opening the GUI application, the user will have to select the week they want to get the data from. After the user locks their choice, the GUI makes 2 calls: one to the backendWebScraper and one to update the database. This call will web scrape and update the  database. After that happens, then the user is allowed to access the 3 top charts. We thought this would make more sense so the user isn't making too many calls to the web scraper in one session. 
>
> We also decided on using GitHub (we know you said to do it after) because it made it easier for us to share our code and work on different features simultaneously. Fawaz and Kaede will probably upload a copy to their GitHubs after we submit this final if they choose to do so.
>***end of update***

This GUI application will allow the user to access 3 top charts on the Rolling Stones website. We use web scraping to get the data, store it in a database, and then from there the user can interact with the GUI to display the data in whatever sorted way they like.

The Top 200 Albums and Top 100 Songs charts on the Rolling Stones website that we used here are sorted by a weighted Units score that accounts for sales and streams for that particular item. So the AlbumsDB Table in our database is sorted by default by the Album Units and the SongsDB Table is sorted by the Song Units.

As for the Top 500 Artists table, that table is sorted by the number of total streams the artists have accumulated.

|--ðŸŽ¸  **`backendDB.py`** - converts the dictionaries from backendWebScrapper into a SQL database

|--ðŸŽ¸  **`backendQuery.py`** - functions that make SQL queries for the sorting aspect of the program

|--ðŸŽ¸  **`weeks.py`** - Script to get all of the available input weeks that Rolling Stones will let you webscrape from

|--ðŸŽ¸  **`GUI.py`** - frontend of the program

## ðŸŽ¶ What are the sizes of the tables? 
* **`Top 200 Albums`**: 200 with 9 fields
* **`Top 100 Songs`**: 100 with 8 fields
* **`Top Artist 500`**: 500 with 4 fields

## ðŸŽ¶ Flow Logic
### Graphic Representation
* *Top 500 Artists and Top 100 Songs will also have an option to display rankings graphically (Weeks on Chart).*
* *These are only samples to illustrate the flow of our program. They do not represent the final UI of our program.*
