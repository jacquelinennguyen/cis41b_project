Final Project for Nguyen CIS41B Winter 2021. 

Authors: [Fawaz Al-Harbi](https://github.com/monsieurCat), [Kaede Hamada](https://github.com/KaeMaple9), and [Jacqueline Nguyen](https://github.com/jacquelinennguyen).

## ðŸŽ¶ Overview
This GUI application will allow the user to access 3 top charts on the Rolling Stones website. We use web scraping to get the data, store it in a database, and then from there the user can interact with the GUI to display the data in whatever sorted way they like.

## ðŸŽ¶ Contents
ðŸŽ¸ Media - images

ðŸŽ¸ backendWebScraper - gets all the data from 3 Top charts from the Rolling Stones website

ðŸŽ¸ backendDB - converts the dictionaries from backendWebScrapper into a SQL database

ðŸŽ¸ GUI.py - frontend of the program

## ðŸŽ¶ Samples from the database
Here we display the top 1 item from each table. (As of Friday, March 19)

## ðŸŽ¶ What are the sizes of the tables? 
* **`Top 200 Albums`**: 200 with 7 fields
* **`Top 100 Songs`**: 100 with 7 fields
* **`Top Artist 500`**: 500 with 4 fields

## ðŸŽ¶ Flow Logic
### Graphic Representation
* *Top 500 Artists and Top 100 Songs will also have an option to display rankings graphically (Weeks on Chart).*
* *These are only samples to illustrate the flow of our program. They do not represent the final UI of our program.*
